Develop a generalized Queue collection class that implements basic operations for working with a queue and provides the possibility of iteration by implementing an iterator “manually” (without using the yield block iterator). Test the methods of the developed class.
Develop a generic collection class BinarySearchTree (binary search tree). Provide for the use of a plug-in interface to implement order relationships. There are three ways to traverse the tree: forward (preorder), transverse (inorder), reverse (postorder): to implement, use a yield iterator block.
